    <string name="body">This android application displays nearby bus timing information and bus routes that JUTC operates.
                        This application utilizes the GPS built in to your smart phone to pinpoint your
                        location. The application will then tie you to the nearest bus stop and display a list of the buses arriving
                        at that bus stop in the order of arrival time.

        <item>This is a “cashless system” of bus fare payment, which JUTC commuters can use
              for travel within the Kingston Metropolitan Transportation Region (KMTR). The
              card is reusable and rechargeable and should not be thrown away – similar to a credit card.</item>
        <item>The fleet size is now approximately 460 buses and including the artic, bi-artic, buses for
            the handicapped and luxury coaches. The most common make in the fleet is Volvo.</item>
